	<h1>BlowDry</h1>
	<h3>Platform App Strategy</h3>
	<p>The BlowDry app was a strategy engagement for a popular chain of blow dry bars located around New York City, with hopes of world-wide expansion. The idea behind this concept was to provided a multi-sided platform application for iOS devices. The two sides of this platform app were to be the consumer-facing side and the producer-facing side. This would, in theory, allow for both clientele and hair stylists to interact with one another, much like the popular app Uber operates.<!--Fucking fascist! Yeah well, that's just, ya know, like, your opinion, man. Sure. That and a pair of testicles. Fortunately I've been adhering to a pretty strict drug regimen to keep my mind, you know, limber. Well, you know, the Dude abides. You got the wrong guy. I'm the Dude, man. Well sir, it's this rug I have, really tied the room together.--></p>

		<h2>In Conclusion</h2>
		
		<p>I don't know about you, but I take comfort in that. It's good knowin' he's out there, the Dude, takin' her easy for all us sinners. Shit. I sure hope he makes The finals. Welp, that about does her, wraps her all up. Things seem to've worked out pretty good for the Dude'n Walter, and it was a purt good story, dontcha think? Made me laugh to beat the band. Parts, anyway. Course—I didn't like seein' Donny go. But then, happen to know that there's a little Lebowski on the way. I guess that's the way the whole durned human comedy keeps perpetuatin' itself, down through the generations, westward the wagons, across the sands a time until— aw, look at me, I'm ramblin' again. Wal, uh hope you folks enjoyed yourselves.</p>
